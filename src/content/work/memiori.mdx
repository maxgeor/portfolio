<Section title="Problem">
  Developers make blockchain apps by...

  1. Writing code
  2. Uploading the code to Ethereum or another blockchain as `smart contracts`
  3. Building a `frontend` for those contracts (usually an app or website) so people can use them.

  To save time, blockchain developers use `frontend generators`, which take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is the most popular frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects.

  The problem? **Etherscan's frontend sucks**.

  - It's a list of technically-named forms
  - It's at the bottom of the page, behind two drawers
  - It doesn’t give guidance, clear errors, or feedback about your transaction.

  Using their frontend felt more like running an obstacle course — we knew it could be better.

<Section title="Research">
  - Onboarding
    - Show annotated onboarding flow
  - Emotions picking is complicated
    - Too many emotion options
    - Don't need to set emotion for every thought
  - Information architecture
    - Naviation
      - Between views
      - Across thoughts (scrolling through thoughts)
    - Typography
    - Things people care about in the wrong placeholders
      - Streaks hidden
  - Branding
  
</Section>

<Section title="Scope">
  No new major features, just reworking the interface.
</Section>

<Section title="Process">
  Sketch ideas
  Figma
  Prototype interactions in code
</Section>

<Section title="Key Decisions">
  <Section title="Dispursed onboarding" isSubsection={true}>
    - Shortened main onboarding
    - Added Explainer secreen to introduce funtionality
    - Moved non-essential onboarding further down the flow

    _Have before and after mockups of onboarding flow_

    Show new onboarding flow

  </Section>
  
  <Section title="Simplified emotions" isSubsection={true}>
    - Cut emotions to 5
    - Made a clear scale of emotions
      - Easy to pick
      - Easy for to gauage how they felt
      - Good for data analysis
