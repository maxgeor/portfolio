    Developers make blockchain apps by...
    1. Writing code
    2. Uploading it to the blockchain as `smart contracts`
    3. Building a `frontend` (usually an app or website) so people can interact with those contracts.

    To save time, blockchain developers use `frontend generators`. They take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI for it.

    Etherscan is the most popular frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects.

    The problem? **Etherscan's frontends suck**.

    - They're at the bottom of a page, behind two drawers
    - They're a list of technically-named forms for every action in the code
    - They don't give guidance, helpful errors, or feedback about your transaction.

    Their frontends felt more like obstacle courses — we knew they could be better.

    Our high-level solution took shape by thinking about smart contract actions as little forms.
    
    They have a couple fields and a button that does something when pressed. Looking at contract actions this way made Etherscan's shortcomings clear:

    - There's no copy to guide, educate, or update users
    - Layers of irrelevant info buries the UI that actually matters
    - Users have to decipher every action name to find the right one

    With this, our idea formed: **A tool, like Google Forms, that creates landing pages for smart contract actions**.

    ## Research
    Talking with teams & developers using Etherscan gave us two key insights:

    1. _People used Etherscan as a "good enough" interface_. Teams used it for admin-like actions, while blockchain developers used it for personal projects & testing (since they preffered working in the backend).
    2. _Everyone knew Etherscan sucked_ (visually & functionally) but building something custom wouldn't be worth the time & money.
    3. _Almost no one actions through Etherscan that returned data_.

    Takeaways:

    - One-way smart contract actions were a neglected category
    - People still valued UX and might be willing to switch if setup was easy
    - It the bar was _really_ low — we had lots of room to cut scope and still ship something better

    ## Building
    We worked by doing design and development at the same time.

    First, we broke the project into chunks, ordering them by importance, dependence, and unknowns. We'd then design & build each chunk in order.

    Design started with rough sketches. After breadboarding the flows and UI, I’d design the rest in code. While I pushed pixels, Hassan would build out the backend (I’d help later).

    ## Shooing scammers
    We knew three things from the jump:
    
    1. Scammers would use forms to misrepresent contracts<br/>
    2. We couldn't stop them<br/>
    3. But we had to do something<br/>

    _How do we ward off scammers without making the product harder to build or use?_

    ## Filtering & framing technical details
    Smart contracts have tons of strange behaviors:

    - Transactions cost a bit of money
    - Transactions take time to go through
    - Anyone can make a frontend for any contract (becasuse they're public)

    People who know nothing about smart contracts are bound to face confusion, missteps, and exploitation. Although it's a technical topic, there's stuff peple need to understand.

    _Which ideas are essential? How do we share them without overwhelming people?_

    ## Keeping it flexible
    Formie could hook into any contract. It's copy, error handling, and layout had to work with _thousands_ of different actions.

    It also had to work with different brands. Formie is a part of a project's interface. Sometimes, it _is_ the interface. A strong, noteworthy aestheic could clash with the project's brand — confusing users and turning projects away.

    _How do you design an interface that works with a wide range of brands and actions?_

    The most important departure from Etherscan was limiting forms to a single
    action.
    
    For convience, Etherscan puts every action in one place, but
    it's a mess! You end up like Indiana Jones — hacking through jungle and solving puzzles to find the form you want (with luck).

    Linking straight to the action makes it impossible to miss.

    Smart contracts have two kinds of actions: 
    
    - **One-way**: An action that _triggers a change_ (ex: voting, sending money, changing ownership) 
    - **Two-way**: An action that _returns data_ (ex: seeing an account's balance, asking for an NFT's characteristics) 
    
    Two-way actions are complex. Different data needs different layouts, with non-blockchain data getting mixed in. You need something custom to give a great experience.

    One-way actions are simple. Some fields, a button, and a straightforward layout is all you need.

    We decided to only focus on one-way actions — shrinking the scope way down.

   To translate tricky ideas, explain them in Plain English.

    We replaced words like "Method" and "Write" with "Action" and "Send".

    We also **let people write their own titles and descriptions**, cheap and effective way to guarantee that actions made sense.

    Adding editable fields wasn't an easy decision: bad actors could make one action look like another and swindle ignorant users.

    Despite its issues, open text was essential, so we had to design around it.

    We knew we weren't going to stop every scam or build a trustless, zero-proof protocol to do it. We needed something simpler.

    Our solution to ward off bad actors was **forcing users to confirm they trust the form before letting them submit**.

    Most people who get scammed, especially in crypto, are in a rush. They see a hot mint in Discord or Twitter, feel the FOMO, and rush to buy.

    Making people stop to question their source is a easy way to protect users from scammers and themselves.

<Section title="Tradeoffs">
  <SubSection>
    Our priority was speed-to-launch. We focused on shipping something better than the current solution, not the ideal product.
    
    By <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline" target="_blank">comparing to our baseline</a>, we cut important, but non-essential features:

    ## ❓ Editing
    I wanted to allow for custom titles, descriptions, submit buttons, and fields, but implementing authentication would have taken too long.
    Tradeoff: Permanent forms with added form titles and descriptions (acceptable since users could create unlimited forms).

    Comparing to the baseline experience of using Etherscan, moving a single contract action mathout out of Ether

    ## ❓ Custom field titles and descriptions
    Comparing to the baseline, having the Formie package and the same fields was still an improvement for Etherscan users.

    ## ❓ Customized error messages & placeholders
    Handling different errors across well smart contracts was difficult.

<Section title="Result">
  <SubSection>
    Formie got featured by the Milk Road and was picked as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort. While it got traction and was used by developers, we realized that many smart contract interfaces needed a custom solution.

    Since Formie couldn't make enough money to justify the work needed to build it out, we decided to put Formie on hold and focus on other projects.
