<h1>Problem</h1>

  Developers make blockchain apps by...

  1. Writing code
  2. Uploading it to Ethereum (or another blockchain) as `smart contracts`
  3. Building a `frontend` for the contracts (usually an app or website) so people can use them.

  To save time, blockchain developers use `frontend generators`, which take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is the most popular frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects.

  The problem? **Etherscan's frontend sucks**.

  - It's a list of technically-named forms
  - It's at the bottom of the page, behind two drawers
  - It doesn’t give guidance, clear errors, or feedback about your transaction

  Using their frontend felt more like running an obstacle course — we knew it could be better.

<Section id="idea">
  <h1>Idea</h1>

  Our high-level solution took shape after framing smart contract actions as _mini forms_: They have a couple of fields and a button that does something when pressed.

  Seeing actions this way made Etherscan’s shortcomings clear:

  - There's no copy to guide, educate, or update users
  - Layers of irrelevant details bury [the UI that actually matters](#one-page,-one-action)
  - Users have to decipher every action name to find the right one

  With this, our idea formed: **A tool, like Google Forms, that creates landing pages for smart contract actions**.

<Section id="research">
  <h1>Research</h1>

  Talking to teams & developers using Etherscan gave us three key insights:

  1. _They used Etherscan as a “good enough” interface_. Developers avoided writing code for stuff like admin actions, personal projects, and tests.
  2. _They used Etherscan for [one-way actions](#only-supporting-one-way-actions)_ (code that triggers a change). Two-way actions almost always had their own frontend.
  3. _They knew Etherscan sucked_ (visually & functionally) but weren't willing to invest the time & money or have the confidence to make something custom.

  Takeaways:

  - One-way actions were underserved
  - People still valued UX and might be willing to switch if the setup was easy
  - The bar was low — we had lots of room to [cut scope](#tradeoffs) while shipping something better.

<Section id="process">
  <h1>Process</h1>

  We worked by doing design and development at the same time.

  First, we broke the project into chunks, ordering them by importance, dependence, and unknowns. Then, we’d design & build each chunk in order.

  Design started with rough sketches. After breadboarding the flows and UI, I’d finish the rest in code. While pushing pixels, Hassan would build the backend (I’d help after design).

  <h1>Challenges</h1>

  <Section id="shooing-scammers" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>Shooing scammers</h2>

    We knew three things from the jump:

    1. Scammers would use forms to misrepresent contracts
    2. We couldn't stop them
    3. But we had to do something.

  </Section>

  <Section id="filtering-&-framing-technical-details" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>Filtering & framing technical details</h2>

    Smart contracts have tons of strange behaviors:

    - Transactions cost a bit of money
    - Transactions take time to go through
    - Anyone can make a frontend for any contract (because they're public).

    The reason are technical, but anyone who doesn’t understand why will face confusion, missteps, and exploitation.

  </Section>

  <Section id="keeping-it-flexible" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>Keeping it flexible</h2>
  
    Formie can plug into any contract, so its copy, error handling, and layout had to work with _thousands_ of actions.

    It also had to work with different brands. Formie is part of a project's interface. Sometimes, it _is_ the interface. A strong aesthetic could clash with the project's brand — confusing users and turning projects away.

    [How do we design a universal interface](#only-supporting-one-way-actions) that serves many brands and actions?

<Section id="key-decisions">
  <h1>Key Decisions</h1>

  <Section id="one-page,-one-action" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>One page, one action</h2>

    The main departure from Etherscan was limiting forms to a single action.

    Etherscan puts every action in one place, but it's a mess! You end up like Indiana Jones, hacking through layers and deciphering hieroglyphics to find the form you want.

    Linking straight to the action makes it impossible to miss.

  </Section>

  <Section id="only-supporting-one-way-actions" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>Only supporting one-way actions</h2>

    Smart contracts have two kinds of actions:

    - `One-way`: An action that _triggers a change_<br/>(ex: Voting, sending money, changing ownership)
    - `Two-way`: An action that _returns data_<br/>(ex: Seeing an account's balance, getting an NFT's characteristics)

    Two-way actions are complex. Different data needs different layouts, with non-blockchain data getting mixed in. These constraints make a custom UI necessary to deliver a great experience.

    One-way actions are simple. They need a straightforward layout with fields and a button, which is easy to standardize. Our research also found that [they’re underserved relative to two-ways](#research).

    To serve lots of actions consistently, we decided to focus only on one-way actions.

  </Section>

  <Section id="letting-people-write-their-own-title-and-description" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>Letting people write their own title and description</h2>

    To translate tricky ideas, we replaced technical terms (“method”, “write”) with Plain English (“action”, “send”).

    But this wasn’t enough. Every action needed something explained that static language couldn’t cover. To guarentee that any action could be understood, we let people customize the title and description. It's a simple but effective way to keep forms flexible without adding complexity.

    Deciding to let people edit wasn’t easy, since it would make it easier to misrepresent actions and swindle users.

    Having open text was essential, though, so we had to design around it.

  </Section>

  <Section id="making-people-confirm-trust" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>Making people confirm trust</h2>

    We couldn’t stop every scam or build a trustless, zero-proof protocol to do it. Instead, we detered scammers by making people confirm they trusted the form before submitting it.

    Most people who get scammed, especially in crypto, are in a rush. They see a hot mint in Discord or Twitter, feel the FOMO, and pay.

    Forcing people to question their source was a cheap, but effective way to protect users from scammers and themselves.

<Section id="tradeoffs">
  <h1>Tradeoffs</h1>

  Our priority was speed-to-launch. We focused on shipping something better than the current solution, not the ideal product.

  By [comparing to our baseline](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline), we cut some non-essential features:

  <Section id="infinite-forms" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>~~Editing forms~~ Infinite forms</h2>

    We wanted to let people edit forms after creation. But, late in development, we realized the backend would need a week-long rewite to handle secure edits.

    Instead of rebuilding, we decided to...

    1. Let people make unlimited forms, and
    2. Make forms permanent (for security reasons).

    People could "edit" their forms by making another one, which only took ~30 seconds. Since forms had little content, we figured folks wouldn’t edit much anyways. If we learned later that people edit a lot, we could add it. Until then, disposable forms were good enough.

    Ironically, this "tradeoff" gave us editing for free, letting us ship a few hours later.

      images={[
        {
          src: "/work/formie/tradeoffs/no-editor/one-time-message.png",
          alt: "One-time notice on list page",
        },
        {
          src: "/work/formie/tradeoffs/no-editor/callout.png",
          alt: "Callout in editor preview",
        },
        {
          src: "/work/formie/tradeoffs/no-editor/new-plan.png",
          alt: "Plan for new solution",
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section id="customize-title-&-description" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>Customize ~~everything~~ title & description</h2>

    We wanted every part of a form to be customizable:

    - Field titles, descriptions, placeholders
    - Error messages
    - Button label, etc.

    But, because we cut editing, all customizations had to happen on the form creation page. We knew setting every option in one go would be too overwhelming.

    To simplify, we only let people customize their form’s title and description. Because top-level fields gave context to the entire form, static fields wouldn’t kill usability.

    Limited customization kept form creation straightforward while offering more control than Etherscan.

      images={[
        {

          alt: "Realization that only title & description would be enough",
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section id="limited-error-messaging" isSubsection={true}>
    <h2>~~Perfect~~ Limited error messaging</h2>

    We wanted to translate every error into a clear, helpful message, but Ethereum was too limited.

    At the time, a protocol to standardize errors like HTTP didn't exist for smart contracts. Every contract handled issues differently, with no way to label common errors.

    It was impossible to translate errors consistently, so we settled on...

    1. Humanizing basic type errors
    2. Wrapping unknown errors in an honest, generic message.

    Compromising on error handling stung, but you can only do so much when working with a black box.

<Section id="result">
  <h1>Result</h1>

  Formie ended up getting used by teams and developers. It was also featured by Smoothie and The Milk Road as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort. 

  Despite the usage, we decided to put the product on auto-pilot. After launch, we discovered lots of cases where people needed tiny customizations. The tweaks had little overlap, so there was no elegant, standardized solution support for each.

  Since the improvements didn't make sense to invest time and money into, we decided to keep Formie as is and only support the original use case.
