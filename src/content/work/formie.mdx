    Developers make blockchain apps by...
    1. Writing code
    2. Uploading it to the blockchain as `smart contracts`
    3. Building a `frontend` (usually an app or website) so people can interact with those contracts.

    To save time, blockchain developers use `frontend generators`. They take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI for it.

    Etherscan is the most popular frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects.

    <hr class="h-px border-t border-[#d1d5db] border-dashed my-0"></hr>

    The problem? **Etherscan's frontends suck**.

    - They're at the bottom of a page, behind two drawers
    - They're a list of technically-named forms for every action in the code
    - They don't give any guidance, helpful errors, or feedback about your transaction.

    Their frontend felt more like an obstacle course than a useful tool — we knew it could be better.

    Our high-level solution took shape after framing smart contract actions as mini forms.
    
    They have a couple fields and a button that does something when pressed. Looking at contract actions this way made Etherscan's shortcomings clear:

    - There's no copy to guide, educate, or update users
    - Layers of irrelevant info buries <a class="anchor" href="#one-page-one-action">the UI that actually matters</a>
    - Users have to decipher every action name to find the right one

    With this, our idea formed: **A tool, like Google Forms, that creates landing pages for single smart contract actions**.

    ## Research
    Talking with teams & developers using Etherscan gave us three key insights:

    1. _People used Etherscan as a "good enough" interface_. Teams used it for admin-like actions, while blockchain developers used it for personal projects & testing (since they preffered working in the backend).
    2. _Everyone knew Etherscan sucked_ (visually & functionally) but weren't willing to invest the time & money to build something custom.
    3. _Etherscan was almost exclusively used for <a class="anchor" href="#only-supporting-one-way-actions">one-way actions</a>_ (two-way actions tended to have custom frontends).

    Takeaways:

    - One-way smart contract actions were neglected
    - People still valued UX and might be willing to switch if setup was easy
    - It the bar was _really_ low — we had lots of room to <a class="anchor" href="#tradeoffs">cut scope</a> and still ship something better.

    ## Building
    We worked by doing design and development at the same time.

    First, we broke the project into chunks, ordering them by importance, dependence, and unknowns. We'd then design & build each chunk in order.

    Design started with rough sketches. After breadboarding the flows and UI, I’d design the rest in code. While I pushed pixels, Hassan would build out the backend (I’d help after).

    ## Shooing scammers
    We knew three things from the jump:
    
    1. Scammers would use forms to misrepresent contracts<br/>
    2. We couldn't stop them<br/>
    3. But we had to do something<br/>

    <a class="anchor" href="#making-people-confirm-trust">How do we ward off scammers</a> without making the product harder to build or use?

    ## Filtering & framing technical details
    Smart contracts have tons of strange behaviors:

    - Transactions cost a bit of money
    - Transactions take time to go through
    - Anyone can make a frontend for any contract (becasuse they're public)

    People who know nothing about smart contracts are bound to face confusion, missteps, and exploitation. Although it's a technical topic, there's stuff people needed to understand.

    Which ideas are essential? <a class="anchor" href="#using-human-words">How do we explain things</a> without overwhelming people?

    ## Keeping it flexible
    Formie could be used for any contract, so its copy, error handling, and layout had to work with _thousands_ of different actions.

    It also had to work with different brands. Formie is a part of a project's interface. Sometimes, it _is_ the interface. A strong, noteworthy aestheic could clash with the project's brand — confusing users and turning projects away.

    The most important departure from Etherscan was limiting forms to a single
    action.
    
    For convience, Etherscan puts every action in one place, but
    it's a mess! You end up like Indiana Jones — hacking through jungle and solving puzzles to find the form you want (with luck).

    Linking straight to the action makes it impossible to miss.

    Smart contracts have two kinds of actions: 
    
    - `One-way`: An action that _triggers a change_ (ex: voting, sending money, changing ownership) 
    - `Two-way`: An action that _returns data_ (ex: seeing an account's balance, asking for an NFT's characteristics) 
    
    Two-way actions are complex. Different data needs different layouts, with non-blockchain data getting in the mix. These contraints make a custom UI necessary to deliver a great experience.

    One-way actions are simple — all they need are some fields, a button, and a straightforward layout. Our research also <a class="anchor" href="#research">found that they're underserved</a> relative to other tooling.

    We decided to only focus on one-way actions, shrinking our scope way down.

    To translate tricky ideas, we replaced technical terms ("Method", "Write") with Plain English ("Action" and "Send").

    While the copy was clean, we knew our static wording wouldn't help communicate the unique context of every action.

    To guarantee that any action could be made clear, we let people write their form's title and description.

    Adding editable fields wasn't an easy decision though: bad actors could make one action look like another and swindle ignorant users.

    Despite its issues, open text was essential, so we had to design around it.

    We knew we weren't going to stop every scam or build a trustless, zero-proof protocol to do it. We needed something simpler.

    Our solution to ward off bad actors was forcing users to confirm they trust the form before letting them submit.

    Most people who get scammed, especially in crypto, are in a rush. They see a hot mint in Discord or Twitter, feel the FOMO, and rush to buy.

    Forcing people to stop and question their source is a easy way to protect users from scammers and themselves.

    Our priority was speed-to-launch. We focused on shipping something better than the current solution, not the ideal product.
    
    By <a class="anchor" href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline" target="_blank">comparing to our baseline</a>, we cut important, but non-essential features:

    ## Replacing editing with infinite forms
    We planned to let people edit their forms after creation. But, late in development, we realized the backend would need a week-long rewite to handle secure edits.

    Instead of rebuilding, we decided to..

    1. Let people make unlimited forms, and
    2. Make forms permanent (for security reasons).

    People could "edit" their forms by making another one, which only took ~30 seconds. Since forms didn't have much content, we figured people wouldn't need to edit much anyways.

    If we learned after launch that people edit frequently, we could add it, but edit via replacement might be enough.

    Ironically, this "tradeoff" gave us editing for free, letting us ship a few hours later.

    ## Only letting people customize the title & description
    Originally, wanted every part of a form to be editable:

    - Field titles, descriptions, placeholders
    - Error messages
    - Button label, etc.

    Because we cut editing, all customizations had to happen on the form creation page. Making someone set all these options in one go would be overwhelming.

    To keep it simple, we decided to only allow the form's title and description to be customized.

    This worked becasue the form's title and description do 80% of the work. Custom fields had one job: make forms clear. Because top-level fields gave context to the entire form, customizing other fields wasn't essential.

    Limited customization kept form creation easy, while still offering more control than Etherscan.

    ## Limited error messaging
    We wanted to translate every error into a clear, helpful message, but Ethereum was too limited.

    At the time, a protocol to standardize errors like HTTP didn't exist for smart contracts. Every contract handled issues differently, with no way to label common errors.

    It was impossible to translate errors consistently, so we settled on...

    1. Humanizing basic type errors
    2. Wrapping other errors in an honest, generic message

    We weren't jazzed about this compromise, but you can only do so much when working with a black box.

<Section title="Result">
  <SubSection>
    Formie got featured by the Milk Road and was picked as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort. While it got traction and was used by developers, we realized that many smart contract interfaces needed a custom solution.

    Since Formie couldn't make enough money to justify the work needed to build it out, we decided to put Formie on hold and focus on other projects.
