    This is how developers make blockchain apps:

    1. Write the code
    2. Upload the code to a blockchain (like Ethereum)
    3. Build a “frontend” for the code (an app or website), so people can use it

    Most developers build these frontends from scratch, which takes time & effort. Instead, some blockchain developers use “frontend generators”. These tools take your code and create a bare-bones UI for it.

    Etherscan is the most popular frontend generator, saving developers tons of time & hassle.

    The problem? Etherscan's frontend _sucks_.

    - The "frontend" is at the bottom of a page, behind two drawers
    - The "frontend" is actually a list of poorly-named forms for every action in the code.
    - The "frontend" doesn't give guidance, helpful errors, or feedback about your transaction.

    For users, Etherscan felt more like an obstacle course.

    There had to be a better way.

<Section title="Idea">
  <SubSection>
    We realized that smart contract actions were just mini forms: a few fields and a button that did something when pressed. This connection made Etherscan's shortcomings clear:

    - There's no dedicated page for each action
    - There's no labelling or helpful error messaging
    - There's no transaction feedback or confirmation

    The high-level solution started taking shape: A form builder, like Google Forms, but for smart contracts.

<Section title="Research">
  <SubSection>
    We learned from talking with teams & developers using Etherscan that
    
    They used it anyways becasue it saved them lots of time designing and building their own website. Solo smart contract developers in particular leaned on Etherscan because a) they didn't like working in the frontend and b) were stressed out by designing an interface. They were willing to trade off

    ## Research
    We learned from talking with teams & developers using Etherscan that
    
     They used it anyways becasue it saved them lots of time designing and building their own website. Solo smart contract developers in particular leaned on Etherscan because a) they didn't like working in the frontend and b) were stressed out by designing an interface. They were willing to trade off

    ## Building
    We worked by building the product piece-by-piece. We'd figure out the most important chunk of work then start building & designing it together. I skipped mockups, opting to roughly sketch the UI & flow then doing the rest in code.

    {/* Working this way had big benefits:
    1. We were lazer-focused on the biggest problem at a time.
    2. We discovered & resolved constraints in real-time, avoiding expensive re-designs.
    3. We covered key risks upfront, making our to-do list easy to trim as our deadline approached. */}

<Section title="Challenges">
  <SubSection>
    ## Trust
    Our biggest risk was bad actors using Formie to misrepresent contracts to scam people. People who know about crypto have trust issues, while everyone else aren't aware of the risks. The most important thing was Formie would die if it didn't  We had to be proactive about deterring

    ## Simple vs Secure
    We knew tons of non-technical people would use Formie. My first was to make the experience seamless — abstracting away all the complexity associated with smart contracts.

    The problem was that there are some things people _need_ to know about smart contracts to gauge how legit a form is. Looking at a pretty form, who would think anything was at risk?
    -
    - If you get scammed, there's no way to get your money back or find out who the scammer is

    We had to find a balance between simplicity and security.

    Smart contracts are inherently technical . While it's tempting to abstract away all complexity, leaving out key details about how smart contracts would leave users uninformed and misinformed about the legitimacy of the form. We had to craft a seamless experience while  bet making Formie simple and secure.
    3. Overabstracting the details would confuse non-technical users and potentially expose them to scams.

    While it needs What did people _really_ needed to know about smart contracts so they could guage how legit a form is?

    ## Universality
    Not only does the form need to work with most smart contracts, but it also needs to work with most brands. Projects and companies will use Formie as an extension of their brand, so it needs to be flexible enough to fit in with their voice and aesthetic.

    ## Key Decisions
    - Human words
      -  Ditched technical terms like "Method" and "Writing"
    - Figuring out how to deter spammers and protect people from getting scammed (**forcing people to confirm trust**)
      - We knew try to stop scammers from making a form would be impossible, so we focused on making it clear who the form was for and what it did.
      - Most of the time, anyone can detect a scam with some time and effort
        - it often involves, double checking the form's source or asking a smart friend to make sure it's kosher.
        - Also why we always include a link to the Etherscan page
      - Went from asking "How do we make sure no one gets scammed?" to "How do we make sure anyone "
      - Simple 80/20 solution
      - Easy to understand, no technical stuff to explain
      - soft-lock
      - great because people don't need to understand the technical parts — as long as
    - One-way methods only
      - There are two kinds of actions on a smart contract:
        - One-way: You hit a button and _make some change_ (ex: voting, sending money, changing ownership)
        - Two-way: You hit a button and _get something back_ (ex: a Cryptopunk's characteristics)
      - Custom interfaces and tools like Dune and Etherscan covered pulling and displaying of data fine.
      - Most of people used Etherscan for write methods (Mint, renouncing Ownership).
      - Not having to focus on displaying data simplified Formie's job.
    - Custom titles & descriptions
    - Trust confirmation

<Section title="Identity">
  <SubSection>
    I held off on crafting the brand identity. I focused on answering the products core questions first then let the emerging constraints guide the identity.

    To have a universal brand, the colors needing a neutral pallate. Blue was the most unopinioned color one and has connotations with safety and reliability.

    The typography came from the product needing a friendly tone. The layout was sparce, so there was room for character in the text. and has a lot of character without

    I try to to overthink identity and let core constraints guide the design. Sometimes, the brand of a product comes first, if its philosophy is core to the product.

<Section title="Tradeoffs">
  <SubSection>
    ## Custom field titles and descriptions
    Comparing to the baseline, having the Formie package and the same fields was still an improvement for Etherscan users.

    ## Editing
    I wanted to allow for custom titles, descriptions, submit buttons, and fields, but implementing authentication would have taken too long.
    Tradeoff: Permanent forms with added form titles and descriptions (acceptable since users could create unlimited forms).

    Comparing to the baseline experience of using Etherscan, moving a single contract action mathout out of Ether

    ## Remembering pending transactions when users leave the page
    Most transactions were short enough that users wouldn't navigate away, and the pending transaction copy helped ease users' concerns.

    Our priority was speed-to-launch. This lead us to cut important but non-essential features by [comparing to baseline](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline): Is this V1 better than people's current solution?
    - No custom branding (not important — getting most of the value from the form)
    - Seeing the problem
    - Realizing the high-level solution (**form builder**)
      - Familiar experinece for using and creating forms

        - Anticipate common post-mint issues on success screen

  <Section title="Result">
    Formie got featured by the Milk Road and was picked as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort. While it got traction and was used by developers, we realized that many smart contract interfaces needed a custom solution.

    Since Formie couldn't make enough money to justify the work needed to build it out, we decided to put Formie on hold and focus on other projects.
