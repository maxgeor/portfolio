    Developers make blockchain apps by...
    1. Writing code
    2. Uploading it to the blockchain as `smart contracts`
    3. Building a `frontend` (usually an app or website) so people can interact with the contracts.

    To save time, blockchain developers use `frontend generators`. They take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI.

    Etherscan is the biggest frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects.

    The problem? **Etherscan's frontends suck**.

    - The "frontend" is at the bottom of a page, behind two drawers
    - The "frontend" is a list of forms with technical names for every action in the code.
    - The "frontend" doesn't give guidance, helpful errors, or feedback about your transaction.

    It felt more like an obstacle course than a tool — we knew it could be better.

    Our high-level solution took shape after framing smart contract actions as mini forms.
    
    They have a couple fields and a button that does something when pressed. Looking at contract actions this way made Etherscan's shortcomings clear:

    - There's no copy to guide, educate, or update users
    - Layers of irrelevant stuff hide the UI that actually matters
    - Users have to decipher every action name to find the right one

    With this, our idea formed: **A tool, like Google Forms, that creates landing pages for smart contract actions**.

    ## Research
    Talking with teams & developers using Etherscan gave us two key insights:

    - _People used Etherscan as a "good enough" interface_. Teams used it for admin-like actions that didn't deserve fancy interfaces. Blockchain developers used it for personal projects & testing, since they preffered working in the backend.
    - _Everyone knew Etherscan sucked_ (visually & functionally) but weren't willing to build something themselves.

    ## Building
    First, we broke the project into chunks, ordering them by importance, dependence, and unknowns. Then, we designed & built each chunk in order.

    Design started with rough sketches. After breadboarding flows and UI, I’d jump into code and design the rest. Hassan would build the backend while I designed (I’d join when finished).

    ## Shooing scammers
    We knew three things from the jump:
    
    1. Scammers would use forms to misrepresent contracts<br/>
    2. We couldn't stop them<br/>
    3. But we had to do something<br/>

    How do we deter scammers without making the product harder to build or use?

    ## Filtering & framing technical truths
    They're tons of strange facts & behavious behaviours around smart contracts:

    - Transactions cost a bit of money
    - Transactions can take a while to complete
    - Anyone can make a frontend for any contract (becasuse they're public)

    People without a clue are bound for confusion, missteps, and exploitation.

    What facts are essential? How do we explain them without overwhelming users?

    ## Keeping it flexible
    - Has to work well with a ton of different actions
    - Has to work well with a ton of different brands (unopinioned aesthetic)

    Formie form would be an extension of a project's product, or the only interface to a product.

    Not only does the form need to work with most smart contracts, but it also needs to work with most brands.

    How do you design an interface that works with a wide range of brands and actions?

    ## Key Decisions
    - Human words
      - Ditched technical terms like "Method" and "Writing"
    - Figuring out how to deter spammers and protect people from getting scammed (**forcing people to confirm trust**)
      - We knew try to stop scammers from making a form would be impossible, so we focused on making it clear who the form was for and what it did.
      - Most of the time, anyone can detect a scam with some time and effort
        - it often involves, double checking the form's source or asking a smart friend to make sure it's kosher.
        - Also why we always include a link to the Etherscan page
      - Went from asking "How do we make sure no one gets scammed?" to "How do we make sure anyone "
      - Simple 80/20 solution
      - Easy to understand, no technical stuff to explain
      - soft-lock
      - great because people don't need to understand the technical parts — as long as
    - One-way methods only
      - There are two kinds of actions on a smart contract:
        - One-way: You hit a button and _make some change_ (ex: voting, sending money, changing ownership)
        - Two-way: You hit a button and _get something back_ (ex: a Cryptopunk's characteristics)
      - Custom interfaces and tools like Dune and Etherscan covered pulling and displaying of data fine.
      - Most of people used Etherscan for write methods (Mint, renouncing Ownership).
      - Not having to focus on displaying data simplified Formie's job.
    - Custom titles & descriptions
    - Trust confirmation

<Section title="Tradeoffs">
  <SubSection>
    ## Custom field titles and descriptions
    Comparing to the baseline, having the Formie package and the same fields was still an improvement for Etherscan users.

    ## Editing
    I wanted to allow for custom titles, descriptions, submit buttons, and fields, but implementing authentication would have taken too long.
    Tradeoff: Permanent forms with added form titles and descriptions (acceptable since users could create unlimited forms).

    Comparing to the baseline experience of using Etherscan, moving a single contract action mathout out of Ether

    ## Remembering pending transactions when users leave the page
    Most transactions were short enough that users wouldn't navigate away, and the pending transaction copy helped ease users' concerns.

    Our priority was speed-to-launch. This lead us to cut important but non-essential features by [comparing to baseline](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline): Is this V1 better than people's current solution?
    - No custom branding (not important — getting most of the value from the form)
    - Seeing the problem
    - Realizing the high-level solution (**form builder**)

  <Section title="Result">
    Formie got featured by the Milk Road and was picked as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort. While it got traction and was used by developers, we realized that many smart contract interfaces needed a custom solution.

    Since Formie couldn't make enough money to justify the work needed to build it out, we decided to put Formie on hold and focus on other projects.
