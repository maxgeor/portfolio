    Using Etherscan to call smart contracts _sucks_. Seeing friends, family and Twitter struggle made it's flow feel more like an obstacle course:

    1. To find the right action, you go the bottom of the page and open two technically-worded drawers
    2. Then, you have to decypher a list of actions to find the right one
    3. Finally, if you find the action, its technical wording and weak feedback makes it near-impossible to know what info to give or know if the transaction worked at all.

    Etherscan's UI-in-a-box was a developer favourite, but we knew it could be better.

<Section title="Idea">
  <SubSection>
    Our big a-ha came from realizing that smart contract actions were just mini forms: a few inputs and a button that makes something happen. 
    
    Why didn't we treat these actions like any other form? Could we make a form builder that gave these actions standalone pages?

<Section title="Process">
  <SubSection>
    We built Formie by breaking the project into chunks of work. Each was sequenced by unknowns & dependencies and tracked in FigJam. 
    
    We'd work by designing and building each chunk together. I'd make a rough sketch of the UI & flow then design it in code.

<Section title="Challenges">
  <SubSection>
    ## Trust
    The biggest risk is bad actors using Formie to misrepresent a contract and scam people. People who know about crypto have trust issues, while everyone else aren't aware of the risks.

    ## Communication
    A form that interacts with a blockchain has big differences that aren't obvious:

    - Transactions cost money, instead of nothing
    - Transactions take time to process, instead of instant
    - Smart contract code can be seen and used by anyone, instead of being private

    non-technical people
    While it needs What did people _really_ needed to know about smart contracts so they could guage how legit a form is?

    ## Universality
    Not only does the form need to work with most smart contracts, but it also needs to work with most brands. Projects and companies will use Formie as an extension of their brand, so it needs to be flexible enough to fit in with their voice and aesthetic.

    ## Key Decisions
    - Human words
      -  Ditched technical terms like "Method" and "Writing"
    - Figuring out how to deter spammers and protect people from getting scammed (**forcing people to confirm trust**)
      - We knew try to stop scammers from making a form would be impossible, so we focused on making it clear who the form was for and what it did.
      - Most of the time, anyone can detect a scam with some time and effort
        - it often involves, double checking the form's source or asking a smart friend to make sure it's kosher.
        - Also why we always include a link to the Etherscan page
      - Went from asking "How do we make sure no one gets scammed?" to "How do we make sure anyone "
      - Simple 80/20 solution
      - Easy to understand, no technical stuff to explain
      - soft-lock
      - great because people don't need to understand the technical parts — as long as
    - One-way methods only
      - There are two kinds of actions on a smart contract:
        - One-way: You hit a button and _make some change_ (ex: voting, sending money, changing ownership)
        - Two-way: You hit a button and _get something back_ (ex: a Cryptopunk's characteristics)
      - Custom interfaces and tools like Dune and Etherscan covered pulling and displaying of data fine.
      - Most of people used Etherscan for write methods (Mint, renouncing Ownership).
      - Not having to focus on displaying data simplified Formie's job.
    - Custom titles & descriptions
    - Trust confirmation

<Section title="Tradeoffs">
  <SubSection>
    ## Custom field titles and descriptions
    Comparing to the baseline, having the Formie package and the same fields was still an improvement for Etherscan users.

    ## Editing
    I wanted to allow for custom titles, descriptions, submit buttons, and fields, but implementing authentication would have taken too long.
    Tradeoff: Permanent forms with added form titles and descriptions (acceptable since users could create unlimited forms).

    Comparing to the baseline experience of using Etherscan, moving a single contract action mathout out of Ether

    ## Remembering pending transactions when users leave the page
    Most transactions were short enough that users wouldn't navigate away, and the pending transaction copy helped ease users' concerns.

    Our priority was speed-to-launch. This lead us to cut important but non-essential features by [comparing to baseline](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline): Is this V1 better than people's current solution?
    - No custom branding (not important — getting most of the value from the form)
    - Seeing the problem
    - Realizing the high-level solution (**form builder**)
