    Developers make blockchain apps by...
    1. Writing code
    2. Uploading it to the blockchain as `smart contracts`
    3. Building a `frontend` (usually an app or website) so people can interact with the contracts.

    To save time, blockchain developers use `frontend generators`. They take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI for it.

    Etherscan is the most popular frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects.

    The problem? **Etherscan's frontends suck**.

    - It's is at the bottom of a page, behind two drawers
    - It's a list of technically-named forms for every action in the code
    - It doesn't give guidance, helpful errors, or feedback about your transaction.

    It felt more like an obstacle course than a tool — we knew it could be better.

    Our high-level solution took shape by thinking of smart contract actions as little forms.
    
    They have a couple fields and a button that does something when pressed. Looking at contract actions this way made Etherscan's shortcomings clear:

    - There's no copy to guide, educate, or update users
    - Layers of irrelevant info buries the UI that actually matters
    - Users have to decipher every action name to find the right one

    With this, our idea formed: **A tool, like Google Forms, that creates landing pages for smart contract actions**.

    ## Research
    Talking with teams & developers using Etherscan gave us two key insights:

    - _People used Etherscan as a "good enough" interface_. Teams used it for admin-like actions, while blockchain developers used it for personal projects & testing (since they preffered working in the backend).
    - _Everyone knew Etherscan sucked_ (visually & functionally) but building something custom wouldn't be worth the time & money.

    Takeaways:

    - One-way smart contract actions were a neglected category
    - People still valued UX and might be willing to switch if setup was easy
    - It the bar was _really_ low — we had lots of room to cut scope and still ship something better

    ## Building
    We worked by designing and building at the same time.

    First, we broke the project into chunks, ordering them by importance, dependence, and unknowns. We'd then design & build each chunk in order.

    Design started with rough sketches. After breadboarding flows and UI, I’d jump into code to design it out. While designing, Hassan would build the backend (I’d help after finishing).

<Section title="Challenges">
  <SubSection>
    ## Shooing scammers
    We knew three things from the jump:
    
    1. Scammers would use forms to misrepresent contracts<br/>
    2. We couldn't stop them<br/>
    3. But we had to do something<br/>

    _How do we ward off scammers without making the product harder to build or use?_

    ## Filtering & framing technical details
    Smart contracts have tons of strange facts & behavious behaviours:

    - Transactions cost a bit of money
    - Transactions take time to go through
    - Anyone can make a frontend for any contract (becasuse they're public)

    People with no clue are bound to face confusion, missteps, and exploitation. Even though it's technical, there's stuff you just need to know.

    _Which facts are essential? How do we communicate them without overwhelming users?_

    ## Keeping it flexible
    Because Formie could hook into any contract, it's copy, error handling, and layout had to accomodate _thousands_ of different actions.

    It's aestheic also had to fit with different brands. Formie acts as an extension of a project's interface. Sometimes, it _is_ the interface. A strong, noteworthy aestheic would clash with the project's brand — confusing users and turning projects away.

    _How do you design an interface that works with a wide range of brands and actions?_

<Section title="One page, one action">
  <SubSection>
    The most important departure from Etherscan was limiting forms to a single
    action.
    
    Etherscan puts every action in one place for your convience, but
    it's a mess! You end up cutting through jungle & solving puzzles
    like Indiana Jones to find the form you want — it's madness, seriously!!!

    Just give people a link to the form.

    No fuss. No muss. Just the form.

<Section title="One-way actions only">
  <SubSection>
    There are two kinds of actions on a smart contract: 
    
    - One-way: You hit a button and trigger a change_ (ex: voting, sending money, changing ownership) 
    - Two-way: You hit a button and _get data back_ (ex: a Cryptopunk's characteristics) 
    
    Two-way actions are complex. Every project needs to show their data differently, and pull from data outside the blockchain. Custom UI is the only way to create a great experience.

    One-way actions, on the other hand, are simple. They just need a couple fields and a button. Plus, people rarely used two-way actions through Etherscan.

    We decided to focus exclusively on one-way actions — shrinking the problem to something manageable.

<Section title="Human words">
  <SubSection>
    Not only do we ditch techno-bable like "Method" and "Write" for plain english, but let people write the words themselves! no better way to ensure the right info is on any given form that to let form makers put them there!

    I also know that there's info someone would need on the page that I could never imagine. Giving someone a blank slate with good formatting opens a world of possibilities and makes the forms work for a wide array of use cases.

    This may seem like a trivial decision when comparing it to

<Section title="Force to confirm trust">
  <SubSection>
    Our solution to ward off spammers was forcing people to confirm that they trust the form before letting them submit.

    We knew we weren't going to stop every scam or build a trustless, zero-proof protocol to do it. We needed something simpler.

    Most people who get scammed, especially in crypto, are in a rush. They see a link to a sick mint on Discord or Twitter and act out of FOMO.

    Detecting spammers isn't rocket science. Often, double checking the source or asking a friend is enough to sniff out a scam.

    Adding a soft lock is enough to save most people from scams (and cover our butt, legally).

<Section title="Tradeoffs">
  <SubSection>
    Our priority was speed-to-launch. We weren't shipping the ideal product, but something better than what people have right now.
    
    <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline" target="_blank">Comparing to baseline</a>, we cut some important but non-essential features:

    ## No editing

    I wanted to allow for custom titles, descriptions, submit buttons, and fields, but implementing authentication would have taken too long.
    Tradeoff: Permanent forms with added form titles and descriptions (acceptable since users could create unlimited forms).

    Comparing to the baseline experience of using Etherscan, moving a single contract action mathout out of Ether

    ## No custom field titles and descriptions

    Comparing to the baseline, having the Formie package and the same fields was still an improvement for Etherscan users.

    ## No customized error messages or placeholders
    Handling different errors across well smart contracts was difficult.

<Section title="Result">
  <SubSection>
    Formie got featured by the Milk Road and was picked as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort. While it got traction and was used by developers, we realized that many smart contract interfaces needed a custom solution.

    Since Formie couldn't make enough money to justify the work needed to build it out, we decided to put Formie on hold and focus on other projects.
