    Developers make blockchain apps by...
    1. Writing code
    2. Uploading it to the blockchain as `smart contracts`
    3. Building a `frontend` (usually an app or website) so people can interact with those contracts.

    To save time, blockchain developers use `frontend generators`. They take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI.

    Etherscan is the most popular frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects.

    The problem? **Etherscan's frontend sucks**.

    - It's a list of technically-named forms
    - It's at the bottom of the page, behind two drawers
    - It doesn't give you guidance, helpful errors, or feedback about your transaction

    Using their frontend felt like running an obstacle course — we knew it could be better.

    Our high-level solution took shape after framing smart contract actions as mini forms.
    
    They have a couple of fields and a button that does something when pressed. Looking at contract actions this way made Etherscan's shortcomings clear:

    - There's no copy to guide, educate, or update users
    - Layers of irrelevant info bury <a class="anchor" href="#one-page,-one-action">the UI that actually matters</a>
    - Users have to decipher every action name to find the right one

    With this, our idea formed: **A tool, like Google Forms, that creates landing pages for stand-alone smart contract actions**.

    ## Research
    Talking with teams & developers using Etherscan gave us three key insights:

    1. _People used Etherscan as a "good enough" interface_. Teams plugged in their admin actions, while blockchain developers made it their UI for testing & personal projects (since they didn't like writing frontend code).
    2. _Most people used Etherscan for <a class="anchor" href="#only-supporting-one-way-actions">one-way actions</a>_ (code that triggers a change), while two-way actions almost always had custom frontends.
    3. _Everyone knew that Etherscan sucked_ (visually & functionally) but wasn't willing to invest the time & money to build something custom.

    Takeaways:

    - One-way smart contract actions were underserved
    - People still valued UX and might be willing to switch if the setup was easy
    - The bar was low — we had lots of room to <a class="anchor" href="#tradeoffs">cut scope</a> and ship something better

    ## Building
    We worked by doing design and development at the same time.

    First, we broke the project into chunks, ordering them by importance, dependence, and unknowns. We'd then design & build each chunk in order.

    Design started with rough sketches. After breadboarding the flows and UI, I’d design the rest in code. While I pushed pixels, Hassan would build out the backend (I’d help after).

      ## Shooing scammers
      We knew three things from the jump:
      
      1. Scammers would use forms to misrepresent contracts<br/>
      2. We couldn't stop them<br/>
      3. But we had to do something<br/>

      ## Filtering & framing technical details
      Smart contracts have tons of strange behaviors:

      - Transactions cost a bit of money
      - Transactions take time to go through
      - Anyone can make a frontend for any contract (because they're public)

      People who know nothing about smart contracts will face confusion, missteps, and exploitation. Even though it's a technical topic, people had to know some things.

      ## Keeping it flexible
      Formie can plug into any contract, so its copy, error handling, and layout had to work with _thousands_ of actions.

      It also had to work with different brands. Formie is part of a project's interface. Sometimes, it _is_ the interface. A strong aesthetic could clash with the project's brand — confusing users and turning projects away.

    The main departure from Etherscan was limiting forms to a single
    action.
    
    Etherscan puts every action in one place, but it's a mess! You look like Indiana Jones, hacking through jungle and solving puzzles to find the form you want (with luck).

    Linking straight to the action makes it impossible to miss.

    Smart contracts have two kinds of actions: 
    
    - `One-way`: An action that _triggers a change_<br/>(ex: Voting, sending money, changing ownership) 
    - `Two-way`: An action that _returns data_<br/>(ex: Seeing an account's balance, getting an NFT's characteristics) 
    
    Two-way actions are complex. Different data needs different layouts, with non-blockchain data getting mixed in. These constraints make a custom UI necessary to deliver a great experience.

    One-way actions are simple — they need some fields, a button, and a straightforward layout. Our research also <a class="anchor" href="#research">found that they're underserved</a> compared to two-ways.

    We decided to focus on serving one-way actions, shrinking our scope.

    To translate tricky ideas, we replaced technical terms (“Method” “Write”) with Plain English (“Action” “Send”).

    We realized, though, that static language couldn't convey the specific context of every action. To make forms flexible, we let people add a title and description. Now, people could share specific details and instructions for their form, in their own words.

    Deciding to add editable fields was tough: bad actors could make one action look like another and swindle ignorant users.

    Open text was essential, so we had to design around it.

    We knew we couldn't stop every scam or build a trustless, zero-proof protocol to do it. We needed something simple.

    Our solution for deterring bad actors was to make people confirm they trusted the form before submitting it.

    Most people who get scammed, especially in crypto, are in a rush. They see a hot mint in Discord or Twitter, feel the FOMO, and pay.

    Forcing people to stop and question their source is a easy way to protect users from scammers and themselves.

    ## <span class="line-through ">Editing</span> Infinite forms
    We planned to let people edit their forms after creation. But, late in development, we realized the backend would need a week-long rewite to handle secure edits.

    Instead of rebuilding, we decided to..

    1. Let people make unlimited forms, and
    2. Make forms permanent (for security reasons).

    People could "edit" their forms by making another one, which only took ~30 seconds. Since forms didn't have much content, we figured people wouldn't need to edit much anyways.

    If we learned after launch that people edit frequently, we could add it, but edit via replacement might be enough.

    Ironically, this "tradeoff" gave us editing for free, letting us ship a few hours later.

    ## Customize <span class="line-through">everything</span> title & description
    We wanted every part of a form to be customizable:

    - Field titles, descriptions, placeholders
    - Error messages
    - Button label, etc.

    Because we cut editing, all customizations had to happen on the form creation page. Making someone set all these options in one go would be overwhelming.

    To simplify, we only let people customize their form’s title and description. Because top-level fields give context to the entire form, making everything else static still works.

    Limited customization kept form creation straightforward while offering more control than Etherscan.

    ## <span class="line-through">Perfect</span> Limited error messaging
    We wanted to translate every error into a clear, helpful message, but Ethereum was too limited.

    At the time, a protocol to standardize errors like HTTP didn't exist for smart contracts. Every contract handled issues differently, with no way to label common errors.

    It was impossible to translate errors consistently, so we settled on...

    1. Humanizing basic type errors
    2. Wrapping other errors in an honest, generic message

    Compromising on error handling stung, but you can only do so much when working with a black box.

<Section title="Result">
  <SubSection>
    Formie got featured by the Milk Road and was picked as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort. While it got traction and was used by developers, we realized that many smart contract interfaces needed a custom solution.

    Since Formie couldn't make enough money to justify the work needed to build it out, we decided to put Formie on hold and focus on other projects.
