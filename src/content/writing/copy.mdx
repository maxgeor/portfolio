title: Design follows copy
date: '2024-10-03'

Design is semantics.

Design is _what_.

Copy is _what_, written.

God's contract, physics, justification in 5-6 words.

You should know those words.

They're animated, embryotic, destined for life.

How could you birth a corpse? A ghost? There's no greater betrayal.

The words, reduced, brand your conscience like the Cross, carving your path and pointing the way.

Your sliver of the universe has arrived, wrapped in a thought. The soul of your work, your reason to exist â€” manifest.

Now you start.

Until then, stick to Notes.
