title: Design follows copy

Design is _what_.

Copy is _what_, written.

God's contract, physics, justification in 5-6 words.

You should know those words.

They're animated, embryonic, destined for life.

How could you birth a corpse? a ghost? 

There's no greater betrayal.

They brand your conscience like the Cross. 

They carve your path and point the way.

Your sliver of the universe has arrived, wrapped in a thought. 

Your soul, seeded. Your existence, reasoned. Your purpose, manifest.

Now, you start.
