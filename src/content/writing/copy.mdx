Design is _what_.

Copy is _what_, written.

God's contract, physics, justification in 5-6 words.

You should know those words.

They're animated, embryonic, destined for life.

How could you birth a corpse? a ghost? 

There's no greater betrayal.

They brand your conscience as Cross. 

They carve your path and point the way. Won't you carry it?

Your sliver of the universe has arrived. 

Your soul, seeded. Your existence, reasoned.

Now, you start.
