Bad writing gets a bad wrap. When you don't write a lot, everything you write feels "bad" or "not good yet", so you don't write or share anything. If aiming for "good" leads to no writing, then aiming for "bad" can be useful.

## Quality?

What's "bad" anyways? Compared to what? Is "bad writing" long? How long? Is "bad writing" unclear? How unclear? If you write an article you think is bad, but it changes someone's life, is it still bad? There's no ruler. If your words aren't out there, their "goodness" or "badness" means nothing.

## How about Marcus?

Marcus Aurelius (the Emperor of Rome) wasn't aiming for quality when writing to himself. Yet, his notes turned into Meditations — one of history's most impactful works of prose. Had he known they'd be read for centuries, he would have edited, re-edited, questioned, and ditch ideas entirely (if Meditations teaches us anything, it's that he was just as human the rest of us). If Marcus had aimed for "quality", how much wisdom would be lost?

The point of writing is to share ideas, not merely to write them well. Quality is important, but if you aren't writing, isn't bad good enough?
