When in doubt, leave it out

We were almost done the move. One thing was left: The Chair.

“Should we keep it? We have the space”

“I don’t know — I’m not sure if we’ll need it”

“But we might. It’s sitting right outside — why not add it now?“

“Just because it’s easy it add, doesn’t mean we should. Plus, things you might need rarely turn out to”

“But every apartment has a chair — why shouldn’t ours?“

“Because we aren’t every apartment. Just may not need it. It might be better to “
“Just because other apartments have one doesn’t mean we need one. “

“Plus, we can always put it in later.”

So we left it out and never felt the pain.
