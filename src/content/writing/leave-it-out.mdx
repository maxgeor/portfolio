We were almost done the move. One thing was left: The Chair.

“Should we keep it? We have the space”

“I don’t know — I’m not sure if we’ll need it”

“But we might. It’s sitting right outside — why not add it now?“

“Just because it’s easy it add, doesn’t mean we should. Plus, things things you image will be useful tend to not be worth the space they take up.”
