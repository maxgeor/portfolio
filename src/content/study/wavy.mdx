## Problem

- Etherscan is the only way to get a smart contract UI for free
- but.... it SUCKS

  - No context
    - Person just dumped on the top of a page with a bunch of info they can't understand
    - Not
    - No feedback
  - Ugly
    - Should I trust this?
  - Given page with every method

    1. Where am I supposed to find this thing? Oh, it's all the way at the bottom under the fold?
    2. Ok, now which of these methods am I supposed to use?

  - Most people only use one or two methods from a contract

## Process

- Sketched high-level screens + flow
- Scoped all pages + functionality
- Built & designed scope-by-scope
- Build and design at the same time

## Challenges

- How to make it user friendly while still letting people know what they're getting into
- How to make it user friendly

## Decisions

- One method, one page
  - Focus on one method
  - Send someone to one form vs a page
- Permalinks
  - Pages you can link out to
- Custom title + descriptions
  - Give as much context as necessary

## Tradeoffs

We wanted to ship as fast as possible, so we made some tradeoffs:

- No custom error messages per field
  - Most people using it will be at least somewhat experience in Web3
- No custom field titles and descriptions
  - Would have put off shipping
  - Comaring to baseline, just having a well-formatted single-page would be enough
- Only support Etherscan contracts
- No editing
  - Would have had to integrate Sign in w/ Ethereum and change our backend, which would have taken a while.
  - Ok becasue you can make unlimited amounts

## Results

- Featured on Milk Road
