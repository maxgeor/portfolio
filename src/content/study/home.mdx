description: "Redesigned Wavy's homepage to improve event navigation and accessibility. We added a List View with Swimlanes and a Timeline for easier sorting and event tracking, making it the default view. The Calendar View was updated for better spacing and readability with accessible, pastel themes. Differentiated event types through distinct visual styles and icons for quick identification. Lastly, renamed 'Culture Pal' to 'Smart Suggestions', making it clearer and more intuitive for users."

    Wavy’s homepage featured a single calendar view displaying events, notable days, and suggestions. The main issue was it was **hard to find information you care about**. 

    - Calendar items weren’t labeled, making it difficult to quickly identify invites or RSVPs. 
    - Optional themes had harsh, inaccessible colors, making text nearly unreadable. 
    - The view only showed one month at a time, making it hard to find future & past events.

    ### Goal
    Make UI navigable and parsable. Needed to resolve unlabeled events, limited calendar visibility, and inaccessible color themes to let people find their way while reinforcing Wavy’s brand.

    ### Role
    Lead design by researching needs, redesigning flows, UI, and information architecture. Collaborated with the strategy team to ensure the design met both user and business goals.
