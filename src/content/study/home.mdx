description: "Redesigned Wavy's homepage to improve event navigation and accessibility. We added a List View with Swimlanes and a Timeline for easier sorting and event tracking, making it the default view. The Calendar View was updated for better spacing and readability with accessible, pastel themes. Differentiated event types through distinct visual styles and icons for quick identification. Lastly, renamed 'Culture Pal' to 'Smart Suggestions', making it clearer and more intuitive for users."

    Wavy’s homepage featured a single calendar view displaying events, notable days, and suggestions. The main issue was it was **hard to find information you care about**. 

    - Calendar items weren’t labeled, making it difficult to quickly identify invites or RSVPs. 
    - Optional themes had harsh, inaccessible colors, making text nearly unreadable. 
    - The view only showed one month at a time, making it hard to find future & past events.

<Section id="4.00" title="Unique Styling">
  <p slot="context">The old layout had little visual difference between events, notable days, and suggestions, making it hard to tell them apart. We needed each item to have its own visual language that worked across all surfaces, including calendar themes, swimlanes, and "Your events" sections. We gave events a white background with black text, notable days a colored background with colored text, and suggestions a transparent background with a dashed outline and gray text. Events were further distinguished by an icon system showing their status: Invited, Going, Declined, or Went. This made it easier to quickly identify relevant events, especially in the calendar and timeline.</p>

<Section id="5.00" title="Smart Suggestions">
  <p slot="context">The toggle for show notable days and suggestions was named "Culture Pal," which confused users about its purpose. To fix this, we renamed Culture Pal to Smart Suggestions, making it clear that the toggle adds contextual information to the layout. We used a gray sparkle and dashed lines as visual cues for suggestions. This design worked across both List and Calendar views, allowing users to easily spot suggestions wherever they appeared.</p>
