    Developers make blockchain apps by

    1. Writing code
    2. Uploading it to Ethereum or another blockchain as `smart contracts`
    3. Building a `frontend` for those contracts (an app or website) so people can use them.

    To save time, blockchain developers use `frontend generators`, which take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is the most popular frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects.

    The problem? **Their frontend was impossible to use**. After peeling back two layers of UI, all you're given is a list of techincal names. No help or hints. It's so bad, you need a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+mint+from+etherscan).

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      We started by studying what worked with Etherscan's interface. Their "frontend" was a list of forms for each `action` in a smart contract. We were sceptical that a raw, unstyled form was the best layout... but it was.
      
      Turns out, **smart contract actions are super simple**<sup>1</sup>. Most only take 1-2 inputs and return little to no data. The form's focused, linear path makes it perfect for easing people through the unfamiliar flow of calling contracts.

      Contracts have two kinds of actions:

      `One-way` actions _trigger a change, but return nothing_ (ex: voting, sending money, changing ownership).

      `Two-way` actions _return data_, often mixing with non-blockchain data (ex: showing account's balance, getting an NFT's characteristics).

      One-ways were simple enough for Etherscan's UI while two-ways were more complex, often getting custom UIs.

      We wanted to understand why people reached for Etherscan. Calls with teams & developers uncovered some key insights:

      ### They used Etherscan as a “good enough” interface

      Teams used it for admin actions to save time, while developers used it for personal projects and testing to avoid writing frontend code.

      ### They knew Etherscan sucked

      Everyone I talked to was painfully aware of how bad the interface was. Even though projects couldn't justify making something custom, they still valued UX. Given something better with a seamless setup, we believed they'd switch.

    3. Everyone has used Google or Airtable Forms before. Giving contracts a similar structure makes them easy for anyone to understand.

# Key Decisions

## One page, one action

The main departure from Etherscan was limiting forms to a single action.

Etherscan puts every action in one place, but it's a mess! You end up like Indiana Jones, hacking through layers and deciphering hieroglyphics to find the form you want.

Linking straight to the action makes it impossible to miss.

<Image
  src="/work/formie/decisions/one-page.png"
  alt="Form for Uniswap's Delegate action"
/>

## Only supporting one-way actions

We wanted Formie to work for any action, but supporting two-way actions didn't make sense for three reasons:

1. [Most people don't use Etherscan frontends for two-way actions](#etherscan-was-mostly-used-for-one-way-actions).
2. Supporting two-way actions would've made the product harder to use.
3. Tools like Dune Analytics and specialized blockchain explorers already scratch the itch.

We couldn't create a great interface for two-way methods, so we decided to focus on our core use case by only supportting one-way actions.

Ditching two-ways axed our scope and got a leaner product out the door.

<Image
  src="/work/formie/decisions/one-way-actions.png"
  alt="Form for Uniswap's Delegate action"
/>

## Letting people write their own titles and descriptions

To translate tricky ideas, we replaced technical terms (“method”, “write”) with Plain English (“action”, “send”).

But it wasn’t enough. Every action needed something explained that static language couldn’t cover. To guarentee that any action could be understood, we let people write their own titles and descriptions. It was a simple but effective way to keep forms flexible without adding complexity.

Deciding to let people edit wasn’t easy, since open text makes it trivial to misrepresent actions. But letting people edit was essential, so we had to design around it.

<Image
  src="/work/formie/decisions/title-and-description.png"
  alt="UI for editing title & description"
/>

## Making people confirm trust

We couldn’t stop every scam or build a trustless, zero-proof protocol to do it. Instead, we detered scammers by making people confirm they trusted their form before submitting.

Most people who get scammed, especially in crypto, are in a rush: They see a hot mint in Discord, feel the FOMO, and write a check.

Forcing people to question their source was a cheap, but effective way to protect users from scammers and themselves.

# Tradeoffs

Our priority was speed-to-launch. We focused on shipping something better than the current solution, not the ideal product.

By [comparing to our baseline](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.5-chapter-14#compare-to-baseline), we cut some non-essential features:

<h2 id="replacing-editing-with-infinite-forms" aria-label="Replacing editing with infinite forms">~~Editing forms~~ Infinite forms</h2>

We wanted to let people edit forms after creation. But, late in development, we realized the backend would need a week-long rewrite to handle secure edits.

Instead of rebuilding, we decided to...

1. Let people make unlimited forms, and
2. Make forms permanent (for security reasons).

People could "edit" their forms by making another one, which only took ~30 seconds. Since forms had little content, we figured folks wouldn’t edit much anyways. We could always add feature later if we learned that people edit a lot. Until then, disposable forms were good enough.

Ironically, this "tradeoff" gave us editing for free, letting us ship a few hours later.

    },
  ]}
/>

<h2 id="only-letting-people-customize-their-title-&-description" aria-label="Only letting people customize their title & description">~~Customize everything~~ Title + description</h2>

We wanted every part of a form to be customizable:

- Field titles, descriptions, placeholders
- Error messages
- Button labels, etc.

But, because we cut editing, all customizations had to happen on the form creation page. We knew setting every option in one go would be too overwhelming.

To simplify, we only let people customize their form’s title and description. Because the top-level fields gave context to the entire form, they could handle 80%-90% of the clarification.

Limited customization kept form creation straightforward while offering more control than Etherscan.

    },
  ]}
/>

<h2 id="limited-error-messaging" aria-label="Limited error messaging">~~Perfect~~ Limited error messaging</h2>

We also planned on translating every error into a clear, helpful message, but Ethereum was too limited.

At the time, a protocol to standardize errors like HTTP didn't exist for smart contracts. Every contract handled issues differently, with no way to label common errors.

It was impossible to translate errors consistently, so we settled on...

1. Humanizing basic type errors
2. Wrapping unknown errors in an honest, generic message.

Compromising on error handling stung, but you can only do so much when working with a black box.

# Result

Formie ended up getting used by teams and developers. It was also featured by Smoothie and The Milk Road as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort.

Despite the usage, we decided to put the product on auto-pilot. After launch, we discovered lots of cases where people needed tiny customizations. The tweaks had little overlap, so there was no elegant, standardized solution support for each.

Since the improvements didn't make sense to invest time and money into, we decided to keep Formie as is and only support the original use case.
