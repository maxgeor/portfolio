  problem: Etherscan's frontend sucked
  solution: Airtable Forms, but for smart contract actions
  decisions:
    - Every action gets its own page
    - Only supported one-way actions
    - Made form titles and descriptions open text
    - Forced people to confirm trust before submitting
  tradeoffs:
    - Cut editing, let people make unlimited forms
    - Only let people customize title & description

<Context title='Problem'>Developers make blockchain apps by 1/ Writing code 2/ Uploading it to Ethereum or another blockchain as smart contracts 3/ Building a frontend for those contracts (an app or website) so people can use them. To save time, <mark>blockchain developers use frontend generators, like Etherscan</mark> which take your code and spit out a bare-bones, working UI. Etherscan is the most popular frontend generator, powering tons of Ethereum projects. Blockchain developers use tools like Etherscan to get a basic UI for free. But <mark>Etherscan's UI sucks</mark>. 1/ It's a list of <mark>technically-worded</mark> forms 2/ It’s <mark>hard to navigate</mark> 3/ It <mark>shares little feedback</mark> about transactions.</Context>

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      Contracts have two kinds of actions:

      `One-way` actions _trigger a change, but return nothing_ (ex: voting, sending money, changing ownership).

      `Two-way` actions _return data_, often mixing with non-blockchain data (ex: showing account's balance, getting an NFT's characteristics).

      One-ways were simple enough for Etherscan's UI while two-ways were more complex, often getting custom UIs.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      We wanted to understand why people reached for Etherscan. Calls with teams & developers uncovered some key insights:

      ### Etherscan was a “good enough” interface
      Teams used it for admin actions to save time, while developers used it for personal projects and testing to avoid writing frontend code.

      ### They knew Etherscan sucked
      Everyone I talked to was painfully aware of how bad the interface was. Even though projects couldn't justify making something custom, they still valued UX. Given something better with a seamless setup, we believed they'd switch.

    1. One-way actions (which covered most use cases) worked well with form-like layouts.

    3. Everyone has used Google or Airtable Forms before. Giving contracts a similar structure makes them easy for anyone to understand.

  <div class="flex flex-col gap-4 ">
    Formie can plug into any contract, so its copy, error handling, and layout had to work with _thousands_ of actions.

    It also had to work with different brands. Formie is part of a project's interface. Sometimes, it _is_ the interface. A strong aesthetic could clash with the project's brand — confusing users and turning projects away.

    Smart contracts have tons of strange behaviors:

    - Transactions cost a bit of money
    - Transactions take time to go through
    - Anyone can make a frontend for any contract (because they're public)

    The reason are technical, but anyone who doesn’t understand why will face confusion, missteps, and exploitation.

    <h2>One page, one action</h2>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      The main departure from Etherscan was limiting forms to a single action.

      Etherscan puts every action in one place, but it's a mess! You end up like Indiana Jones, hacking through layers and deciphering hieroglyphics to find the form you want.

      Linking straight to the action makes it impossible to miss.

    <h2>Only supporting one-way actions</h2>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      We wanted Formie to work for any action, but supporting two-way actions didn't make sense for three reasons:

      1. [Most people don't use Etherscan frontends for two-way actions](#etherscan-was-mostly-used-for-one-way-actions).
      2. Supporting two-way actions would've made the product harder to use.
      3. Tools like Dune Analytics and specialized blockchain explorers already scratch the itch.

      We couldn't create a great interface for two-way methods, so we decided to focus on our core use case by only supportting one-way actions.

      Ditching two-ways axed our scope and got a leaner product out the door.

    <h2>Letting people write their own titles and descriptions</h2>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      To translate tricky ideas, we replaced technical terms (“method”, “write”) with Plain English (“action”, “send”).

      But it wasn’t enough. Every action needed something explained that static language couldn’t cover. To guarentee that any action could be understood, we let people write their own titles and descriptions. It was a simple but effective way to keep forms flexible without adding complexity.

      Deciding to let people edit wasn’t easy, since open text makes it trivial to misrepresent actions. But letting people edit was essential, so we had to design around it.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      We couldn’t stop every scam or build a trustless, zero-proof protocol to do it. Instead, we detered scammers by making people confirm they trusted their form before submitting.

      Most people who get scammed, especially in crypto, are in a rush: They see a hot mint in Discord, feel the FOMO, and write a check.

      Forcing people to question their source was a cheap, but effective way to protect users from scammers and themselves.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      We wanted to let people edit forms after creation. But, late in development, we realized the backend would need a week-long rewrite to handle secure edits. Instead of rebuilding, we decided to

      1. Let people make unlimited forms, and
      2. Make forms permanent (for security reasons).

      People could "edit" their forms by making another one, which only took ~30 seconds. Since forms had little content, we figured folks wouldn’t edit much anyways. We could always add feature later if we learned that people edit a lot. Until then, disposable forms were good enough.

      Ironically, this "tradeoff" gave us editing for free, letting us ship a few hours later.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      We wanted every part of a form to be customizable:

      - Field titles, descriptions, placeholders
      - Error messages
      - Button labels, etc.

      But because we cut editing, people would only have one shot to customize everything before their form is made. We knew this would be too overwhelming.

      To simplify, we only let people customize their form’s title and description. Because the top-level fields gave context to the entire form, they do 80-90% of the communicating anyways.

      Limited customization kept form creation straightforward while offering more control than Etherscan.

      We also planned on translating every error into a clear, helpful message, but Ethereum was too limited.

      At the time, a protocol to standardize errors like HTTP didn't exist for smart contracts. Every contract handled issues differently, with no way to label common errors.

      It was impossible to translate errors consistently, so we settled on...

      1. Humanizing basic type errors
      2. Wrapping unknown errors in an honest, generic message.

      Compromising on error handling stung, but you can only do so much when working with a black box.

  <p class="col-span-full md:col-span-2 xl:col-start-2 ">Formie ended up getting used by teams and developers. It was also featured by Smoothie and The Milk Road as a top project from their Milk Money Cohort.</p>
  <p class="col-span-full md:col-span-2">Despite the usage, we decided to put the product on auto-pilot. After launch, we discovered lots of cases where people needed tiny customizations. The tweaks had little overlap, so there was no elegant, standardized solution support for each.</p>
  <p class="col-span-full md:col-span-2">Since the improvements didn't make sense to invest time and money into, we decided to keep Formie as is and only support the original use case.</p>
