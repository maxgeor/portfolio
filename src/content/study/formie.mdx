description: Personal project to replace Etherscan's smart contract UI with an form-based design. It simplifies interactions by dedicating one page per action, enforcing trust confirmation, and supporting one-way transactions. You can customize titles and descriptions, balancing ease-of-use with security. While editing is limited, the streamlined approach earned Formie recognition as a top product by Milk Road.

  <p slot="context">Lots of smart contract developers hate building frontends. Instead, many use "frontend generators" to get a free, working UI in minutes. <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_blank">Etherscan</a> is the most popular one, powering tons of Ethereum projects. The problem? **Etherscan's UI sucks**. <MarkedNumber number={1} /> It's a list of technically-worded forms, <MarkedNumber number={2} /> It's hard to navigate and <MarkedNumber number={3} /> It shares little feedback about transactions. It's bad enough that begginers need a Youtube tutorial.</p>

      **Etherscan worked best with one-way actions** (like voting or sending ETH), which trigger changes without returning data. Two-way actions, which return more complex data (like checking balances or viewing NFTs), often needed custom UIs to handle the extra complexity. The straightforward layout made navigating one-way actions easy, while two-ways required more tailored solutions.

  <p slot="context">Realizing smart contracts worked like mini forms made us wonder: <mark class="solution">What if we applied form builder patterns to smart contracts?</mark> You could solve most of the UX issues by [1] giving every action a [dedicated page](#one-page-one-action), [2] letting people [write their own copy](#letting-people-write-their-own-titles-and-descriptions) [3] sharing clear, thoughtful feedback about transactions.</p>

<Section id="3.00" title="Only one-way actions">
  <Fragment slot="context">
    Formie had to integrate with any contract, meaning its copy, error handling, and layout needed to adapt to _thousands_ of actions. It also had to be flexible enough to work seamlessly across different brands. **Focusing on one-way actions** made Formie a universal solution. This narrowed the scope, avoided potential edge cases, and targeted the core functionality used by the majority of projects.

<Section id="4.00" title="Confirming trust" >
  <Fragment slot="context">
    We knew scammers could exploit forms to misrepresent contracts from the start. While stopping them entirely wasn't feasible, we needed a way to protect users without overcomplicating the product. **Requiring users to confirm trust** became our solution. Many scams succeed because people act too quickly, especially in crypto. By forcing users to actively confirm trust, we slowed things down, giving them more time to make informed decisions.

<Section id="5.00" title="Open text fields">
  <Fragment slot="context">
    Smart contracts have quirks like transaction costs, delays, and public access to frontends. These technical details confuse users. To simplify, we replaced jargon with plain English ("method" became "action"). Still, users needed more control, so we let them write their own titles and descriptions, keeping forms flexible without adding complexity.

  <Fragment slot="context">
    Editing after form creation required a week-long backend rewrite. Instead, we **made forms permanent but easy to duplicate**, letting users "edit" by creating new forms in ~30 seconds. This saved development time and allowed faster shipping. Full customization was overwhelming without edits, so we **limited customization to titles and descriptions**. This kept forms simple while providing essential context.
