description: "Redesigned Wavy's event analytics page to provide long-term insights and support customer renewals. We introduced time-based data views, showing trends over quarters, years, and all-time. Key stats like participation, spending, and feedback are front and center, with breakdowns by department and year-over-year comparisons. We also added nested charts to zoom into event groupings, allowing for detailed exploration of event performance across different timeframes."

<Section id="1.00" title='Problem' hasBorder={false}>
  <p slot="context">Wavy built an event analytics page as a hackathon project, but it wasn’t used much due to limited data and lack of design. As customers used Wavy longer, they requested long-term insights to justify renewals. Engagement teams needed proof of Wavy’s value, so sales manually pulled and averaged data for presentations. New requests also came in for data on spending, department-level engagement, and event performance. The insights page needed updates to handle these requests and display averaged data.</p>
</Section>
<Section id="2.00" title='Insights Page'>
  <p slot="context">We updated the insights page to display data over quarters, years, and all-time, offering a clear view of long-term trends. High-level stats are front and center, supported by graphs showing key data points across time for each subsection. Participation, spend, and feedback are organized into time-based layouts, with breakdowns by department for more detailed insights. We also added last year comparables to stats to help companies track their internal progress, rather than comparing against external benchmarks.</p>

<Section id="3.00" title='Grouping Events'>
  <p slot="context">With hundreds of events in a quarter, displaying them over time was crucial—simple lists weren’t enough. We designed **nested charts that let users zoom into event groupings** by month, week, or day. This approach offered a clean, organized view, allowing users to explore events at any level of detail they needed..</p>
