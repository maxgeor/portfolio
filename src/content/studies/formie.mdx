## Problem

- Etherscan is the only way to get a smart contract UI for free
- but.... it SUCKS
  - No context
    - Person just dumped on the top of a page with a bunch of info they can't understand
    - Not
  - Ugly
    - Should I trust this?
  - Given page with every method
    1. Where am I supposed to find this thing? Oh, it's all the way at the bottom under the fold?
    2. Ok, now which of these methods am I supposed to use?
  - No feedback

## Process

- Noodle in notes
- Figure out UI with sketches
- Jump right into code
- Build and design at the same time

## Decisions

- One method, one page
  - Focus on one method
  - Send someone to one form vs a page
- Permalinks
  - Pages you can link out to

## Tradeoffs

- No custom error messages per field
  - Most people using it will be at least somewhat experience in Web3
