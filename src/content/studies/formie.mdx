<FirstParagraph text="Anyone who's called a smart contract method on Etherscan knows how frustrating it can be." />

1. **They're hard to find**. Methods are hidden under the fold, behind a bunch of nerd words.
2. **They're hard to understand**. You're left to decrypt the method names to find the right one.
3. **There's no feedback**. Transactions take time, but Etherscan doesn't give updates, leaving you feeling anxious and confused.

![Annotated page showing how bad Etherscan's smart contract UI is](../../../public/studies/formie/annotated-etherscan-page.png "Doesn't it suck??")

We refused to believe that this was the best solution. We thought, "Wait, aren't these 'methods' just mini forms?"

**Why couldn't we make Google Forms, but for smart contracts?"**

## Challenges

Crafting a friendly, focused experience was table stakes, but other requirements made it extra challenging:

### Trust vs Ease

The biggest risk is bad actors using Formie to misrepresent a contract and scam people.
But, you don't want to overwhelm people with technical details.

- How much detail to you share? What information is essential for every user?
- How do you protecting users from scammers (and themselves) while crafting a seamless experience?

**Solution**: link to contract, make it clear what it's doing, but with the right framing, you can have it both ways

### Universality

Every method had different needs & context, but needs a universal interface.

- How do you create an interface, voice, and aesthetic that works, regardless of the method? (univesally approachable)?

**Solution**: Balanced voice, stripped-back aesthetic, custom copy (flexible communication)

## Here are some big decisions we made

I made several key design decisions to improve the user experience:

- **Just a regular form**: Wrap single methods into standalone forms.

- **Human words**: Ditched technical terms like "Method" and "Writing". Let people give forms their own title and descriptions to allow explanation.

- **Trust > seamlessness**: I ensured that users knew who they were sending money to by linking to the contract and requiring trust confirmation.
- Clear transaction feedback: I worked on creating anxiety-relieving copy and ensuring non-technical users could understand and act on the information provided.

## Process

1. I sketched out the high-level UI/flow
2. Batching & sequencing pages/functionality
3. Code & design scope-by-scope

## Solution

The answer was simple: Wrap a familiar form around the smart contract. I realized that smart contract methods were just like web forms, so why not make them more accessible by using a form-based approach?

To make Formie more intuitive, I:

- Created single pages for single methods, avoiding the confusion of having all methods on one page.
- Focused on a visually appealing UI to build trust and enhance the user experience.

## Things we left out

Time was my biggest constraint, which led to several tradeoffs:

### Custom field titles and descriptions

Comparing to the baseline, having the Formie package and the same fields was still an improvement for Etherscan users.

### Editing form content

I wanted to allow for custom titles, descriptions, submit buttons, and fields, but implementing authentication would have taken too long.
Tradeoff: Permanent forms with added form titles and descriptions (acceptable since users could create unlimited forms)

### Remembering pending transactions when users leave the page

Most transactions were short enough that users wouldn't navigate away, and the pending transaction copy helped ease users' concerns.
