  <h1>Max Georgopoulos</h1>
  <p class="col-span-2">
    Primarily a frontend engineer, with full-stack experience. I've
    owned multiple features, taking responsiblity for planning,
    development, and release. I also have product design experience (in-house & freelance). My
    blended skills let me bridge gaps within product teams and ship
    polished interfaces.
    <!-- I don't believe in barriers between disciplines. Research, shaping projects, UI, writing copy, building, are all one thing. -->
    <!-- Think full stack from concept, to design and implementation -->
