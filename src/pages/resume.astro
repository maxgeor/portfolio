  <h1 class="font-bold">Max Georgopoulos</h1>
  <p class="col-span-4">
    Product designer with a full stack approach. I've worked across every step of product development, from strategy/shaping, leading projects, designing UI, and building multiple features end-to-end. Blending disciplines lets me do cohesive, uncompromised work, filling the cracks where detail, quality & soul usually get lost.
